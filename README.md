# Title: Programming Assignment 2: CFG Program
## Quick Summary
_____
#### This C++ program takes an string input and validates or invalidates on the Context Free Grammer (CFG) shown in the figure below. The program will accept strings that ending with a $. At the start of the program, it will ask a user for a string the in a while loop will check if the string is a valid paser or not using if statements. 

## Code Runthrough
_____
- The beginning of the program has the CFG define in code

- First, the program ask a user for an input to check if it is a valid paser

- Implementation of stacks to see if paser is part of the CFG

- To print the stack recursion was used

- Used a while loop and if statements to check if it was part of the CFG

- Printed if it was or not part of the CFG
